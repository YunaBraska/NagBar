# Icinga 2 Integration Lab

This lab runs the real official Icinga 2 image. It is external-system test
infrastructure, not a production fake server.

The image is pinned to the multi-platform Icinga 2.16 digest. The lab exposes
only `127.0.0.1:5665`, uses Icinga's generated private CA, and provides:

- a least-privilege Basic-auth API user;
- a least-privilege X.509 client-certificate API user;
- an authenticated user without object permissions;
- healthy and failing host/service objects;
- generated CA and PKCS#12 artifacts outside the repository.

Create `integration/icinga2/.env.local` from `.env.example`, then run:

```sh
./script/icinga2_lab.sh start
./script/icinga2_lab.sh verify
./script/icinga2_lab.sh stop
```

`start` also creates accepted `nagbar-live-client.nagbar.invalid` and rejected
`nagbar-live-rejected.nagbar.invalid` identities signed by the lab CA. The
PKCS#12 file and CA certificate are written to
`NAGBAR_ICINGA_ARTIFACTS_DIR`. The PKCS#12 password remains only in the ignored
`.env.local` file.

`verify` temporarily imports those dedicated test identities into the default
macOS Keychain, resolves their persistent references through `NagBarCore`,
proves accepted and rejected real mTLS connections, and removes them again. An
interrupted process can leave a test identity behind. In that case, remove only
the two `nagbar-live-*.nagbar.invalid` identities and certificates in Keychain
Access before rerunning. The PKCS#12 files intentionally omit the lab CA so the
test does not import unrelated trust material into the Keychain.

The matrix intentionally treats plain HTTP and no authentication as negative
tests because the Icinga 2 API requires HTTPS and authentication. It also proves
that the lab's private CA is rejected without an explicit trust decision.
